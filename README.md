## See how your community is moving around differently due to COVID-19

As global communities respond to COVID-19, we've heard from public health officials that the same type of aggregated, anonymized insights we use in products such as Google Maps could be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat COVID-19.

These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.

### What’s a Community Mobility Report?
Each Community Mobility Report is broken down by location and displays the change in visits to places like grocery stores and parks. [Learn more about the data.](https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility?hl=en)

We’re working to add more countries, regions and languages in the coming weeks. This is an early release and reports will be updated regularly.

### Preserving privacy
The Community Mobility Reports were developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and protecting people’s privacy. No personally identifiable information, such as an individual’s location, contacts or movement, will be made available at any point.

Insights in these reports are created with aggregated, anonymized sets of data from users who have turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. People who have [Location History](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687?hl=en) turned on can choose to turn it off at any time from their [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols?hl=en) and can always delete Location History data directly from their [Timeline.](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?hl=en)

We also use the same world-class anonymization technology used in our products every day to keep your activity data private and secure. This includes [differential privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAdemDkLsc&feature=youtu.be&hl=en), which adds artificial noise to our datasets, enabling us to generate insights while preventing the identification of any individual person.

Visit Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) to learn more about how we keep your data private, safe and secure.

### How long will these reports be available?
These reports will be available for a limited time, so long as public health officials find them useful in their work to stop the spread of COVID-19.
